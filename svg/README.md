# üìê SVG

**Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)** is a 2D vector image format based on an XML syntax. As a vector image format, SVG graphics can scale infinitely, making them invaluable in responsive design, since you can create interface elements and graphics that scale to any screen size. SVG also provides a useful set of tools, such as clipping, masking, filters, and animations. - [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SVG)
