## 🌎 [Web Graphics](https://github.com/taenykim/Web_Graphics_Archive/tree/master/web-graphics)

**Web graphics** are visual representations used on a Web site to enhance or enable the representation of an idea or feeling, in order to reach the Web site user. Graphics may entertain, educate, or emotionally impact the user, and are crucial to strength of branding, clarity of illustration, and ease of use for interfaces. - [W3C](https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/graphics)

## 🕹 [DOM](https://github.com/taenykim/Web_Graphics_Archive/tree/master/dom)

The DOM (Document Object Model) is an API that represents and interacts with any HTML or XML document. The DOM is a document model loaded in the browser and representing the document as a node tree, where each node represents part of the document (e.g. an element, text string, or comment). - [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/DOM)

## 💄 [CSS](https://github.com/taenykim/Web_Graphics_Archive/tree/master/css)

**Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)** is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media. - [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)

## 📐 [SVG](https://github.com/taenykim/Web_Graphics_Archive/tree/master/svg)

**Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)** is a 2D vector image format based on an XML syntax. As a vector image format, SVG graphics can scale infinitely, making them invaluable in responsive design, since you can create interface elements and graphics that scale to any screen size. SVG also provides a useful set of tools, such as clipping, masking, filters, and animations. - [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SVG)

## 🎨 [Canvas](https://github.com/taenykim/Web_Graphics_Archive/tree/master/canvas)

The **Canvas API** provides a means for drawing graphics via JavaScript and the HTML `<canvas>` element. Among other things, it can be used for animation, game graphics, data visualization, photo manipulation, and real-time video processing. - [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API)

## 🤹‍♀️ [WebGL](https://github.com/taenykim/Web_Graphics_Archive/tree/master/webGL)

**WebGL (Web Graphics Library)** is a JavaScript API for rendering high-performance interactive 3D and 2D graphics within any compatible web browser without the use of plug-ins. WebGL does so by introducing an API that closely conforms to OpenGL ES 2.0 that can be used in HTML5 `<canvas>` elements. This conformance makes it possible for the API to take advantage of hardware graphics acceleration provided by the user's device. - [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API)
